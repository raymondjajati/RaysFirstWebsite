        <p id="basketball">Michael Jordan is the greatest player of all time. Setting the all time record of winning six championships in a row is going to be extremely hard to pass for future players. Kobe Bryant also considered to be one of the greatest of all time, had won five championships with the Lakers. In his 20 seasons, Bryant has broken many records while showing his talents on the floor. LeBron James, personally my favorite player of all time is a player who has a mentality to kill. Watching this man play his game is like witnessing history everyday. From his steals to his dunks, from his blocks to his passes, from his rebounds to his shots, from his mentality to his last seven season of reaching the NBA Finals, you can obviously tell that this man has one goal and that is to win. </p>
